            <p>
                Welcome, young Skywalker. I have been expecting you. You no longer need those. Guards, leave us. I'm looking forward to completing
                your training. In time you will call me Master. You're gravely mistaken. You won't convert me as you did
                my father. Oh, no, my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are mistaken...about a great many things.
                His lightsaber. Ah, yes, a Jedi's weapon. Much like your father's. By now you must know your father can never
                be turned from the dark side. So will it be with you. You're wrong. Soon I'll be dead...and you with me.

            <!--intro paragraph-->
            <p>
                Concentrate...feel the Force flow. Yes. Good. Calm, yes. Through the Force, things you will see. Other places. The future...the
                past. Old friends long gone. Han! Leia! Hmm. Control, control. You must learn control. I saw...I saw a city
                in the clouds. Mmm. Friends you have there. They were in pain. It is the future you see. Future? Will they
                die? Difficult to see. Always in motion is the future. I've got to go to them. Decide you must how to serve
                them best. If you leave now, help them you could. But you would destroy all for which they have fought and
                suffered.

            <p>
                    Ready, are you? What know you of ready? For eight hundred years have I trained Jedi. My own counsel will I keep on who is
                to be trained! A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind. This one a long time have I watched. Never
                his mind on where he was. Hmm? What he was doing. Hmph. Adventure. Heh! Excitement. Heh! A Jedi craves not these things.
                You are reckless!
